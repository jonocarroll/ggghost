## Summary

This is a minor update that provides some new features (supplementary data), 
some improvements (warning on assignment), and some housekeeping (supplementary 
README files moved out of build).

## Test environments
* local linux (Ubuntu 14.04) install, R 3.3.0
* travis-ci linux (default)
* travis-ci Mac (default) 
* win-builder (default)
* appveyor-ci (default)

## Code Coverage: 98.18%

_Slightly decreased due to inclusion of `interactive()` conditionals_

## R CMD check results
**There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs on local check**

win-builder provided 1 NOTE:

**checking CRAN incoming feasibility**

but I am not sure why; I am the existing maintainer for this package.

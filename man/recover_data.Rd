\title{Recover data Stored in a ggghost object}
\usage{
recover_data(x, supp = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A ggghost object from which to extract the data.}

\item{supp}{(logical) Should the supplementary data be extracted also?}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} of the original data, named as it was when used 
  in \code{ggplot(data)}
}
\description{
The data used to generate a plot is an essential requirement for a 
reproducible graphic. This is somewhat available from a ggplot \code{grob} 
(in raw form) but it it not easily accessible, and isn't named the same way 
as the original call.
}
\details{
This function retrieves the data from the ggghost object as it was when it 
was originally called.

If supplementary data has also been attached using \code{\link{supp_data}} 
then this will also be recovered (if requested).

When used iteractively, a warning will be produced if the data to be
extracted exists in the workspace but not identical to the captured version.
